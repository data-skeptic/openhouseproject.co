### Contributing
Thank you for your interest in helping with the OpenHouse project!

We intend for there to be opportunities for anyone interested in getting involved to do so regardless of their available time or technical background. Students and experts alike can contribute.

If you'd like to participate, please email kyle@dataskeptic.com and ask to join our Slack channel.

**Join us for a live chat discussion of the project every Tuesday at 6:30pm PST in the Data Skeptic Slack channel.**

The first step is to drop by our Slack channel and introduce yourself! Tell us about who you are and what your interest in the project is. 

As a second step, figure out which section below best describes the way you'd like to contribute.
