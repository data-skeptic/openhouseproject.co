## Contributing
Thank you for your interest in helping with the OpenHouse project!

We intend for there to be opportunities for anyone interested in getting involved to do so regardless of their available time or technical background. Students and experts alike can contribute.

If you'd like to participate, please email kyle at data skeptic dot com and ask to join our Slack channel.

**Join us for a live chat discussion of the project every Tuesday at 6:30pm PST in the Data Skeptic Slack channel.**

The first step is to drop by our Slack channel and introduce yourself! Tell us about who you are and what your interest in the project is. 

As a second step, figure out which section below best describes the way you'd like to contribute.


### Data Pushers
Do you know of a data source that covers an area we current don't have data for? Are you willing to help get that data streamed into our system? Great! To get started, visit the [Data Source Notes](https://github.com/data-skeptic/data-source-notes) repository which will explain the best procedure for contributing in this way.

You will need a data contributor account in order to upload the data, which can be [created here](/signup/).

### Non-technical Contributions
Pick a task on our [Trello board](https://trello.com/invite/b/XH6nS4dB/14d892fe4b7b442871ccd6d18b289eb8/openhouse-kanban) and volunteer to complete it!

### Developers/API Extenders
Do you have experience in Django Framework for Python? Maybe you can help fix a bug or implement a requested feature in our API. 

We track proposed features and issues with the API here: [http://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues](http://github.com/data-skeptic/home-data-api/issues). If you see something you can tackle, or would like to be coached through, volunteer for the task!

### API Consumers
Right now we're light on data. It's ok, we're in the first phases of the project. In time, we'll be rich in data. At that point, we'll be eager to facilitate lots of machine learning, forecasting, and data visualization projects.
