<h3>About OpenHouse</h3>

<p>OpenHouse is a community project with the objective of gathering, processing, and exploring home purchasing data.</p> 
<p>Today, this data is not readily accessible to the general public on a granular and longitudinal basis, which would be required
  to do interesting analysis.</p>
<p>This project seeks to liberate historical and current data on home sales to enable consumers to make smarter, better informe decisions, and to provide a rich, robust dataset for data scientists and data visualization experts.</p>

<h3>Mission Statement</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Data about active and historic home sales in the United States is difficult if not impossible to access. It is unnecessarily
    obfuscated, harming both buyers and sellers.</li>
  <li>A variety of companies in the vein of Trulia and Zillow have helped consumers, but they don't offer full featured APIs,
    making it impossible for a data scientist to access a sufficient dataset to inform their decisions.</li>
  <li>OpenHouse exists to bring together the people and technology to liberate and analyze this data.</li>
</ul>
